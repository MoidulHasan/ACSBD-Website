        With summer in full swing, scorching hot days have become the norm—which
        means your air conditioner has been working overtime. Of course, for
        some air conditioning systems (like central AC), it's best to have a
        professional come and inspect the unit, check the ductwork, and make
        sure it's operating efficiently. But if you have a portable or window AC
        unit you can definitely clean and repair it yourself without spending
        money on repairs or a new system. <br /><br />
        "Companies like ours should come out and do the heavy maintenance on it,
        but in between, there are air conditioning maintenance tips people can
        follow themselves," says Dave Mejean, HVAC manager at B&W Plumbing and
        Heating Co., Inc., an Angi vendor. "It's like a car: You have to have
        your mechanic tune it up, but there are still things you can do to make
        sure it's running too." <br /><br />
        Whether you have central air or a window unit, check out these air
        conditioning maintenance tips and tricks you can easily do to protect
        yourself from the summer heat. <br /><br />
        The 9 Best Fans to Beat the Heat, According to Our Testing How Often to
        Clean a Window AC Unit There are two primary areas to focus on when it
        comes to cleaning a window AC unit: filters and coils. Filters remove
        the dust from the air and when they're clogged, they force your AC unit
        to work harder and use up more energy to cool your home—that costs more
        for you without delivering results. Coils help move the hot and cold
        air, so make sure they're not clogged with dirt and dust.<br /><br />
        "I would recommend cleaning every two weeks," says Giacomo Calzavara,
        Managing Director of JMATEK North America, a licensee of Honeywell
        portable cooling products.<br /><br />

        Turn off the unit. For safety purposes, it's always a good idea to turn
        off the power and unplug the cord before working on an electrical unit.

        How Often to Clean a Central AC Unit For central AC units, Mejean
        recommends checking the filter every 30 to 60 days to see if it's dirty
        or dusty—lifestyle makes a big difference, since people who have kids or
        pets might have to change it every month, while those who don't have too
        many visitors or animals might only need to swap it out every two to
        three months. <br />
        <br />

        According to a recent survey by American Standard Heating & Air
        Conditioning of 2,000 American homeowners, only 36% of homeowners swap
        out their air filters. "We often tell our clients that simple
        preventative measures like this can take just minutes to do but can help
        ensure your system is working efficiently and can help save money in the
        long run," Brian Kleinschmidt, home improvement expert and American
        Standard Heating & Air Conditioning partner, says.<br />
        <br />

        Cleaning the condenser unit outside is another important part of central
        AC maintenance. This typically only needs to be done once a year, but
        may need to be done more often depending on the location of your unit,
        and if it is prone to lots of debris. " It's important to keep the area
        surrounding [your condenser unit] clean and debris-free," Mika
        Kleinschmidt, home improvement expert and American Standard Heating &
        Air Conditioning partner, says. "A good rule of thumb is to not let any
        plants or other wildlife grow within a 2-foot radius of your air
        conditioner."
